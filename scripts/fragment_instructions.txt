**********************INSTRUCTIONS TO CONNECT THE AR10 HAND**************************
Instructions to attach the AR10 Hand to Baxter using an URDF fragment


**********************CREATE AN URDF FRAGMENT**************************
-----> The fragment is in:

/home/simone/Desktop/catkin_ws/src/ar10_description/urdf/fragment_urdf.urdf
Notice that you have to insert an additional joint in this fragment to connect the base of the hand to the hand of baxter otherwise there will be many errors (the system will detect two separate robots). This joint can be fixed but you have to be careful to the rotation that you are going to apply to align it with baxter

**********************CONNECT THE URDF FRAGMENT**************************
-----> Connect the fragment using:

& rosrun baxter_examples send_urdf_fragment.py -f fragment_urdf.urdf -l left_hand -j left_gripper_base
Remember to press ctrl-c because this script will not print anything and will loop forever


**********************TEST**************************
-----> Now the TF should be ready but if you want to show the robot in simulation using RobotState you have to publish the JointState of the hand.

& roslaunch baxter_moveit experiment_fragment.launch file_name:='/home/simone/Desktop/catkin_ws/trajectories/final_EXP_100_p7.yaml'
this start the publisher and the driver for the hand and opens rviz


**********************DEBUG THE ROBOT DESCRIPTION**************************
-----> IMPORTANT: if you want to debug the urdf in the robot_description you can use 

& rosparam get -p /robot_description > prova.urdf
to create the description inside a file

check_urdf prova.urdf
to display the tree in the terminal

urdf_to_graphiz prova.urdf
to create a visual representation of the tree in pdf


-----> IMPORTANT2: this method will not work if there is another gripper attached to baxter!!
